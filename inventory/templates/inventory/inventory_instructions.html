    <h3>Knights inventory</h3>
    <p>
        Squire maintains the inventory of the Knights. This is structured by maintaining items in a catalogue and
        linking ownerships to those items. An item in the catalogue therefore does not mean that the item is at the Knights!
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to link an item to a member, use the link member button next to the item. Depending on the committees you
        are in this button may not be availlable for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to link an item to as part of the Knights inventory it needs to be linked to a committee. This can
        be done by pressing the link committee button. Depending on the committees you are in, this button may not be
        availlable to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Maintaining catalgoue</h3>
    <p>
        Each committee or member can see and edit their own items as registered in the sytem. Besides that some
        committees have rights to maintain certain catalogues. For instance the BG (Boardgame committee) can maintain
        the entire boardgame catalogue. This allows them to adjust the ownerships of any committee or member
        on the boardgames. Mark certain items as no longer at the Knights or tweak notes on ownerships.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add an item to the catalogue, press the `New &lt;Item type&rt;' button at the top of the catalogue screen.
        Depending on the committees you are in, this button may not be availlable to you.
    </p>
